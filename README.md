## IONIC Eccomerce Website


Ionic is a complete ecommerce shopping website built using React.js, Next.js, Sanity, Stripe, HTML, and CSS. It offers a modern and intuitive online shopping experience that is highly customizable, user-friendly, and secure.

The website was first designed and prototyped in Figma, using both low and high fidelity prototypes to ensure the best possible user experience. User flows were mapped out to simplify the process of finding and purchasing products. Additionally, individual product shots were custom designed to highlight the unique qualities of each product and improve visual appeal.

Ionic's features include:

Customizable product pages with product descriptions, images, and pricing information
Dynamic search functionality that allows customers to quickly and easily find the products they are looking for
User accounts with order history, wishlists, and saved addresses
Secure checkout and payment processing using Stripe
Comprehensive backend management system for inventory management and order fulfillment
This Github repository contains the complete source code for Ionic, allowing you to easily clone and modify the website to suit your specific ecommerce needs.
